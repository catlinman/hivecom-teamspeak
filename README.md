# Hivecom Teamspeak skin#

This is the official skin of the Hivecom Teamspeak server. You can use it for
any other server as well if you please although it should be noted that it is
somewhat based on the theme of the Hivecom [website](http://hivecom.net) and
might not fit with every other server you might be on in Teamspeak.

## Installation ##

To install the skin move this folder's contents to your root client Teamspeak 3
directory (default for the 32-bit version is "C:\Program Files (x86)\TeamSpeak 3
Client\"). From there on all you have to do is to select the Hivecom skin and
icon pack from the design menu. To get there simply navigate to the options menu
and select the design submenu from the list on the left hand side. You will also
need to install the custom font if you want it to show up inside of Teamspeak.
To do so if you are using Windows, right click the font contained within this
folder (Aldrich-Regular.tff) and select the install option from the context
menu.
