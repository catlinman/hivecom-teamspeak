# Hivecom Teamspeak Skin #

This is the official skin of the Hivecom Teamspeak server. You can use it for
any other server as well if you please although it should be noted that it is
somewhat based on the theme of the Hivecom [website](http://hivecom.net) and
might not fit with every other server you might be on in Teamspeak.
