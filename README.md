![](https://github.com/catlinman/hivecom-teamspeak/blob/master/preview.png)

This is a fork of my personal TeamSpeak theme with style conventions following
the Hivecom website and previous TeamSpeak theme of the same name. As such,
this theme's core styling is specific but still on its own stands as a subtle
dark theme with a modern touch and clean icons.

____

Quick summary of the main interface features:
- Dark theme with clear color definitions and a bit of texture
- Consistent design across all application interfaces
- Contrasted icons with visible highlights and easy grepping
- More spacious and breathable design for most elements and containers
- Core server group and channel icon remakes

This theme's primary intention is bringing a bit of new life to the somewhat
dated TeamSpeak core interface, while still retaining the structure that is
familiar to most of us.

## Installation ##

### TeamSpeak Application ###

This is the toughest one. Just press install.

### TeamSpeak Website ###

Simply hit the *download button* to download the style. From there, open the
TeamSpeak style add-on with the application for it to be automatically
installed.

### GitHub ###

Simply clone or download this repository and then move the directories within
*teamspeak* to your application data TeamSpeak directory. The folder structures
should be kept the same. After that, the theme should be available as both a
style and an icon pack within your preferences.

## Icons ##

This add-on in itself contains a corresponding icon pack of the same name
making installation hassle free. Feel free to use your own though but keep in
mind the icons were made with the contrasted highlights in mind!

## Source ##

The theme itself has been well documented and segmented as much as possible and
uses a core set of variables and color declarations that should easily allow
you to search and replace instances within the source code. This way, simple
modifications of highlights and accents should come with ease without breaking
much of the theme itself.

Come to find a design inconsistency or anything else of the sort? Either pop me
an email at contact@catlinman.com or make a pull-request on the [GitHub

this theme resides in.

## License & Attribution ##

Just like with the main NekoSpeak skin this one takes a lot of inspiration and settings from, it share the same license and attribution.

As is specifically stated in the source of this theme as well; this theme takes
major inspiration and conventions from other themes such as
[DarkenTS](https://www.myteamspeak.com/addons/686209af-0b66-4805-b2d7-0e990f7cb9e0)
by *Brady_The*, as well as the fork of that theme titled
[Demus](https://www.myteamspeak.com/addons/3bfce85f-bed4-4b04-a183-41b2b42107b4)
by *GrumpyDemus*. Furthermore, it uses some code from the original *Hivecom*
TeamSpeak skin which was based on *Steam Skin* by Adante.

The icon pack is based on a selection of icons ranging from material design
derived ones with now contrasted edges, remakes of the original Steam icon pack
and completely new icons custom made to fit the theme.

There is no license since this theme builds on derivatives from many others
over the years. Feel free to edit and redistribute the theme as you see fit.
Credit where you feel it's due.
